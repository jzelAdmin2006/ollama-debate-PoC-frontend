# Ollama Debate Tool PoC Frontend

This is a simple frontend for the [Ollama Debate Tool PoC](https://github.com/jzelAdmin2006/ollama-debate-PoC) I've created for my in-depth general eduction project.

## Source reference

In accordance with our school's guidelines, I hereby state the source of the logo. This was originally generated by AI and refined by me independently (vgl. ChatGPT, 2024). As requested, this is the exact prompt with the output:

This project was initially generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8 (vgl. Google, 2024). To clarify for my non-technical examiners: I utilised a widely recognised tool to initialise an Angular project, akin to the process of creating a new Word document where elements such as pre-designed templates, fonts, and styles are generated. It is worth noting that no reputable developer manually initialises an Angular project; therefore, it is generally not customary to cite sources for this process. However, I will include a reference for transparency, particularly as this foundational project scaffolding might also feature in other projects similarly. This ensures that any potential concerns regarding plagiarism are pre-emptively addressed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
